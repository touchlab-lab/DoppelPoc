 * Commands will be processed in the order that they are added, unless a priority is set.
 * Commands with the same priority will be processed in the order they are added.
 * <p/>
 * Higher priority commands are processed BEFORE lower priority.  For example, priority 3 commands are processed after
 * priority 7 commands.
 * <p/>
 * Default priority is 10.
 * <p/>
 * Commands must include a no-arg constructor.  The bus service will fail without this.
 * <p/>
 * If your commands should be persisted, use StoredCommand instead, or some other custom

     * This is where your logic goes.  You must be very careful with how you handle error conditions.
     * <p/>
     * "Soft" issues should throw a TransientException.  This is almost always due to temporary network issues.  These
     * will cause the command to be put back on the queue, and processing to stop.  This preserves the command so its not
     * dropped.  HOWEVER!!!  If you throw a TransientException for something that won't resolve itself, by default
     * it will NEVER be removed.  You will build up commands forever, and (worse) stop further processing.
     * <p/>
     * To eventually quit command processing attempts, use a custom implementation of CommandPurgePolicy.
     * <p/>
     * Also, if processing is stopped due to a TransientException, that command and possibly others will remain
     * in the queue.  Some other event will be required to restart processing.  Either manual, or a network connection
     * listener.
     * <p/>
     * "Hard" issues should throw a PermanentException.  This will remove the command, and call onPermanentError.  Your
     * code will need to deal with the error.  Possibly show a notification to the user, revert DB changes, etc.  Processing
     * will continue on other commands, if they exist.
     * <p/>
     * Be aware, if latter commands depend on this one, they will probably trigger a cascade of errors.  Just FYI. Plan
     * accordingly.
     * <p/>
     * Any unchecked exception coming out of this call will be interpreted as a permanent issue, and also removed. This
     * includes instances of RuntimeException and Error.  In future releases, there may be a need to handle OutOfMemoryError
     * and similar issues in a different way.  If the command always triggers memory limits, it should be removed, but
     * if memory issues are triggered because the rest of the app was using too much memory temporarily, the command may
     * be removed unnecessarily.  Future releases should probably allow the SuperbusService to run in a separate process
     * to reduce the likelihood of this, but that is not possible today.

     * To help with runtime coordination, apps can post messages to live commands.
     * The major use case.  A command that refreshes data from the server is looping through updates.
     * While that is happening, the user wants to update an entity.  Pass a message to cancel updates until the
     * remote update can be processed.  If commands set up properly, data won't be lost, but local data might
     * be temporarily lost, and to the user, it will seem like data has reverted.
     * <p/>
     * If using SQLite, here is the sequence.  It seems complex, but its a generic pattern.
     * <p/>
     * 1) refresh command starts.  While processing, UI resumes.
     * 2) User clicks "save", and the entity update process starts.
     * 3) The update code starts a transaction on the db.
     * 4) Pass a "stop refresh" message to the command queue.
     * 5) The refresh command is still loading remote data, but catches a flag to cancel.
     * 6) While still in the db transaction, update the local entity.
     * 7) Post the remote entity update command.
     * 8) Close the transaction.
     * 9) The refresh command, still in process, checks the cancel flag before updating local db. Cancel.
     * 10) If the refresh command interleaved updates, but still used transactions, as long as it checks the cancel
     * flag, there should be no point at which it overwrites the local modification.
     * 11) Optionally, have the refresh command repost itself.
     * <p/>
     * Make sure the local edit update has a higher priority than the refresh.  In that case, the server call to update
     * will happen before the refresh in all cases, so when the refresh runs, the local changes would've been posted already.
